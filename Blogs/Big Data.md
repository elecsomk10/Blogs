### Big Data Definition

Big Data is the ocean of information we swim in daily - vast zettabytes of data flowing from our computers, mobile devices, and machine sensors. Organizations use this data to _drive decisions, improve processes and policies, and create customer-centric products, services, and experiences_.
Big Data is defined as "big" not just because of its volume, but also due to the variety and complexity of its nature.
Typically, it exceeds the capacity of traditional databases to capture, manage, and process it. And, Big Data can come from anywhere or anything on earth that we can monitor digitally. Weather satellites, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, traffic cameras, and social media trends - these are just a few of the data sources being mined and analyzed to make businesses more resilient and competitive.

### Importance of Big Data Analytics

The true value of Big Data is measured by the degree to which you can analyze and understand it. Artificial Intelligence (AI, machine learning, and modern database technologies allow for big data visualization and analytics to deliver actionable insights - in real-time. Big Data analytics help companies put their data to work - to realize new opportunities and build business models.  
As Geoffrey  Moore, author and management analyst, aptly stated, 
>"Without Big Data analytics, companies are blind and deaf, wandering out onto the Web like deer on a freeway."

### Evolution of Big Data

As inconceivable as it seems today, the Apollo Guidance Computer took the first spaceship to the moon with fewer than 80 kilobytes of memory. Since then, computer technology has grown at an exponential rate - and data generation along with it. The world's technological capacity to store data has been doubling about every three years since the 1980s. Just over 50 years ago when Apollo 11 lifted off, the amount of digital data generated in the entire world could have fit on the average laptop. In 2020, [Statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/871513/worldwide-data-created/) estimates that 64.2 ZB (_1 ZB
=1,000,000,000,000 GB_) of data was created or replicated, and "The amount of digital data created over the next five years will be greater than twice the amount of data created since the advent of digital storage."

### Types of Big Data

Data sets are typically categorized into three types based on their structure and how straightforward (or not) it is to index. 

![Types of Data](https://www.sap.com/dam/application/shared/graphics/what-is-big-data-types.svg)

1. Structured Data: Simplest to organize and search. It can include things like financial data, machine logs, and demographic details. Excel and SQL Databases are good examples of tabular structured data where data is stored in rows and columns. Even when structured data exists in enormous volume, it doesn't necessarily qualify as Big Data because structured data on its own is relatively simple to manage and therefore doesn't meet the defining criteria of Big Data.
2. Unstructured Data: This category of data can include things like social media posts, audio files, images, and open-ended customer comments. This kind of data cannot be easily captured in standard row-column relational databases. Traditionally, companies have struggled to search, manage, or analyze large amounts of unstructured data also to find potential value in analyzing and understanding such data. Instead of spreadsheets or relational databases, unstructured data is usually stored in data lakes, data warehouses, and NoSQL databases. 
3. Semi-structured Data: Hybrid of structured and unstructured data. Emails are a good example as they include unstructured data in the body of the message, as well as more organizational properties such as sender, recipient, subject, and date. Devices that use geo-tagging, time stamps, or semantic tags can also deliver structured data alongside unstructured content.

### Sources of Big Data

The range of data-generating things is growing at a phenomenal rate – from drone satellites to toasters. But for categorization, data sources are generally broken down into three types:

![Sources of Big Data](https://www.sap.com/dam/application/shared/graphics/what-is-big-data-sources.svg)

1. Social Data: Generated by social media comments, posts, images, and increasingly video.
2. Machine Data: IoT devices and machines are fitted with sensors and can send and receive digital data. Globally, the number of data-generating things is rapidly growing - from weather and traffic sensors to security surveillance. 
3. Transactional Data: World's fastest moving and growing data. For example, a large international retailer is known to process over one million customer transactions every hour. And when you add in all the world's purchasing, banking, healthcare, and insurance transactions, you get a picture of the staggering volume of data being generated. 

### 5 V's to define Big Data

Just because a data set is big, it isn’t necessarily Big Data. To qualify as such, data must possess at least the following five characteristics:

![5vs of Big Data](https://www.sap.com/dam/application/shared/graphics/what-is-big-data-5vs.svg)

1. Volume: To fully manage and utilize Big Data, advanced algorithms, and AI-driven analytics are required. But before any of that can happen, there needs to be a secure and reliable means of storing, organizing, and retrieving the many terabytes of data that are held by large companies.
2. Velocity: Today, Big Data technology allows databases to process, analyze, and configure data while it is being generated – sometimes within milliseconds. For businesses, that means real-time data can be used to capture financial opportunities, respond to customer needs, thwart fraud, and address any other activity where speed is critical.
3. Variety: Big Data is typically comprised of combinations of structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data. Traditional databases and data management solutions lack the flexibility and scope to manage the complex, disparate data sets that makeup Big Data.
4. Veracity: While modern database technology makes it possible for companies to amass and make sense of staggering amounts and types of Big Data, it’s only valuable if it is accurate, relevant, and timely. For traditional databases that were populated only with structured data, syntactical errors, and typos were the usual culprits when it came to data accuracy. With unstructured data, there is a whole new set of veracity challenges. Human bias, social noise, and data provenance issues can all have an impact on the quality of data.
5. Value: It’s essential to determine the business value of the data you collect. Big data must contain the right data and then be effectively analyzed to yield insights that can help drive decision-making.

### Benefits of Big Data

Modern Big Data Management solutions allow companies to turn raw data into relevant insights - with unprecedented speed and accuracy. 
1. Product and service development: Big Data analytics allows product developers to analyze unstructured data, such as customer reviews and cultural trends, and respond quickly.
2. Predictive maintenance: In an international survey, McKinsey found that the analysis of Big Data from IoT-enabled machines reduced equipment maintenance costs by up to 40%.
3. Customer Experience: In a 2020 survey of global business leaders, Gartner determined that “growing companies are more actively collecting customer experience data than nongrowth companies.” Analyzing this Big Data allows businesses to improve and personalize their customers’ experience with their brand. In addition to Big Data, CX teams are increasingly taking “thick data” into account. These qualitative insights into customers’ observations, feelings, and reactions are enhancing Big Data and giving companies a more comprehensive understanding of their customers.
4. Resilience and risk management: The COVID-19 pandemic was a sharp awakening for many business leaders as they realized just how vulnerable their operations were to disruption. Big Data insights can help companies anticipate risk and prepare for the unexpected.
5. Cost savings and greater efficiency: When businesses apply advanced Big Data analytics across all processes within their organization, they cannot only spot inefficiencies but to implement fast and effective solutions.
6. Improved competitiveness: The insights gleaned from Big Data can help companies save money, please customers, make better products and innovate business operations.

### How Big Data Works

Big Data works when its analysis delivers relevant and actionable insights that measurably improve the business. In preparation for Big Data transformation, businesses should ensure that their systems and processes are sufficiently ready to gather, store, and analyze Big Data.

![How Big Data Works](https://www.sap.com/dam/application/shared/graphics/what-is-big-data-how-works.svg)

1. Gather Big Data: Much of Big Data is comprised of massive sets of unstructured data, flooding in from disparate and inconsistent sources. Traditional disk-based databases and data integration mechanisms are simply not equal to the task of handling this. Big Data management requires the adoption of in-memory database solutions and software solutions specific to Big Data acquisition.
2. Store Big Data: By its very name, Big Data is voluminous. Many businesses have on-premise storage solutions for their existing data and hope to economize by repurposing those repositories to meet their Big Data processing needs. However, Big Data works best when it is unconstrained by size and memory limitations. Businesses that fail to incorporate cloud storage solutions into their Big Data models from the beginning often regret this a few months down the road.
3. Analyze Big Data: Without the application of AI and machine learning technologies to Big Data analysis, it is simply not feasible to realize its full potential. One of the five V’s of Big Data is “velocity.” For Big Data insights to be actionable and valuable, they must come quickly. Analytics processes have to be self-optimizing and able to learn from experience regularly – an outcome that can only be achieved with AI functionality and modern database technologies.
